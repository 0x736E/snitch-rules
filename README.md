# Introduction

This repository contains a curated list of firewall rules for Little Snitch,
a firewall application for Mac OS X.

Version 4.1 added a feature to subscribe to hosted subscription rules, and this
repository aims to provide some useful rules.

## BlockList

The blocklist rules are sourced primarily from:

## Subscribing
